    <h1>The Web</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>What is the internet?</h2>
    <p>Hardware, the under water wire. Web (World Wide Web) system works on this, Web allows data to be accessed across the internet.</p>

    <h2>Network</h2>
    <p>Use ethernet cable / Wi-Fi / bluetooth to make computers communicate with each other.</p>
    <p>It is hard to connect 100 computers to talk with each other with cable, solution: router</p>
    <p>A Network</p>
    <img src="../assets/images/internet-schema-3.png" alt="">
    <p>Comp A wants to send to B, Comp A gives data to router, router sends it to B and not C or D.</p>
    <p>It is also hard to connect 1000000 computers with just 1 router, solution: connect routers</p>
    <p>A Network of Networks</p>
    <img src="../assets/images/internet-schema-4.png" alt="">
    <p>This has no scaling problem now.</p>
    <p>But this is my network, in my house, how do I connect with my neighbour's network? Hard to use cable from my house to neighbour. Solution: telephone cable.</p>
    <p>Modem - turns my network data into telephone infrastructure kind of data.</p>
    <img src="../assets/images/internet-schema-6.png" alt="">
    <p>How to make sure my data gets to the right neighbour? ISP - company that has special routers that are connected with other ISP's router</p>
    <p>The internet = infrastructure of network</p>

    <h2>Internet Protocol</h2>
    <p>Anything that is linked to a computer has an IP address.</p>
    <p>It is made of 4 numbers seperated by dots: 192.168.2.10 (these can change over time)</p>
    <p>IP has alias like google.com to make it easier to use for us, this is domain name.</p>
    <p>142.250.190.78 domain name is google.com</p>
    <p>Entering both to the browser address bar works</p>
    
    <h2>More Info</h2>
    <p>We say we browse the Web with the Broser</p>
    <p>Internet = technical infrastructure that connects computers (some computers are called Web servers)</p>
    <p>Web = service on the Internet</p>
    <p>There are other services on the Internet such as email and IRC</p>
    <img src="../assets/images/internet-schema-8.png" alt="">

    <h2>Jargon</h2>
    <p>web page = page = HTML + resources like CSS, JS, media (img, sounds, videos) single page that is read and displayed in a web browser (google chrome)</p>
    <p>website = site = collection of pages</p>
    <p>web server = computer that hosts site on the internet</p>
    <p>search engine = service = special site = used for finding other sites (google)</p>
    
    <h3>Process of getting a site</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>web server hosts multiple sites</li>
        <li>pages can be found in their distict URL</li>
        <li>search engine looks for a site with its uniwue location</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>More Info on Jargon</h2>
    <p>Site's pages all share the same domain name. The domain name alone = homepage / the home / site's main web page</p>
    <p>Hosting = pages + resources are available on that computer, server sends pages that it hosts to users.</p>
    <p>Search engine = service = special site that finds other sites and pages</p>
    <p>Broser = infrastructure = software that receive / reads / display HTML doc / sites and pages</p>

    <h2>DNS: Domain Name System = A type of server</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>client type domain name in broser</li>
        <li>browser looks at closest DNS and use it to find domain name's real IP</li>
        <li>browser sends HTTP to the IP, asking for a copy of the site for client</li>
        <li>data is sent from server to client and vice versa using TCP/IP</li>
        <li>data is sent back in chucks, browser assembles the chunks</li>
    </ol>
